# C++ Learning & Practice

This is an experimental project for learning C++ and practicing problem-solving in a structured way and practicing Git & GitHub . The goal is to improve programming skills as a software engineer, explore data structures and algorithms, experiment with new C++ concepts **while improving my workflow** and learn how to use GitHub for version control and sharing.

## Project Structure
- `DataStructures/` – Practice and experiments with different data structures (e.g., LinkedList, Stack, Queue).
- `Algorithms/` – Solutions for various algorithmic problems and exercises.
- `Psets/` – Files for testing code snippets and verifying functionality.

## Purpose
- Enhance C++ programming skills.
- Explore and implement new algorithms and data structures.
- Learn practical Git and GitHub workflows.
- Share personal progress with the programming community.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youssefs20/learning-dsa-cpp.git
   
2.Open the files using any C++ IDE or editor (e.g., VS Code, CLion, Visual Studio).

3.Run the code and experiment with modifications to learn by practice.

## Notes
Each file contains learning experiments or solutions to specific problems.

The project is not meant to be a **finished application**—its purpose is learning and practice.

It’s recommended to try the code and understand it before making changes.

## Learning GitHub
This project is also a hands-on way to learn GitHub:

Commit changes regularly.

Use branches for experimenting.

Push updates to share progress.

It’s a personal repository to track growth and practice version control.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, especially from anyone who wants to collaborate and learn together.
